<h2>About the Recipe</h2>
<p>When we talk about the greatest fried chicken recipes of all time, karaage has to be at or near the top of that list.
     This Japanese-style fried chicken is crispy, juicy, and intensely flavorful, which is even more 
     impressive when you consider the fact that there is no skin or bones involved. 
     However, not all karaage recipes are created equal,    
    and the awesomeness is very much dependent on how and what you coat your chicken pieces in.</p>
<p>For me, that's pure potato starch. While I'm not known for my extensive, and exhaustive, 
    recipe testing, I did many, many tests and experiments, using pretty much every 
    possible combination of starch options; wheat flour, rice flour, cornstarch, et al.,
     and potato starch was the winner. By the way, do not accidently buy potato flour, which is not the same thing, 
    and will not work the same. If you can't find potato starch, 
    which you can, I think cornstarch is the next best option.</p>
