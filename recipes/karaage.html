<h2>About the Recipe</h2>
<p>When we talk about the greatest fried chicken recipes of all time, karaage has to be at or near the top of that list.
     This Japanese-style fried chicken is crispy, juicy, and intensely flavorful, which is even more 
     impressive when you consider the fact that there is no skin or bones involved. 
     However, not all karaage recipes are created equal,    
    and the awesomeness is very much dependent on how and what you coat your chicken pieces in.</p>
<p>For me, that's pure potato starch. While I'm not known for my extensive, and exhaustive, 
    recipe testing, I did many, many tests and experiments, using pretty much every 
    possible combination of starch options; wheat flour, rice flour, cornstarch, et al.,
     and potato starch was the winner. By the way, do not accidently buy potato flour, which is not the same thing, 
    and will not work the same. If you can't find potato starch, 
    which you can, I think cornstarch is the next best option.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li> 1 tablespoon finely grated fresh ginger </li>
    <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
    <li> 3 tablespoons sake</li>
    <li> 1 tablespoon mirin</li>
    <li> ⅛ teaspoon sesame oil</li>
    <li> ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>  1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
    <li> ½ teaspoon white sugar</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    <li>1 ¼ pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
    <li>1 cup potato starch</li>
    <li>1 quart canola oil, or as needed</li> 
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Mix garlic, ginger, soy sauce, sake, mirin, sesame oil,
         black pepper, cayenne, sugar, and salt in a medium bowl.</li>
    <li>Place chicken in the marinade and mix until thoroughly 
        and evenly coated. Cover and refrigerate for 1 to 10 hours.</li>
    <li>Set up your dredging station: Place a wire rack over a foil-lined baking sheet. 
        Add potato starch to a wide, shallow bowl.</li>
    <li>Tap the rack on the baking sheet to remove any loose chunks of starch, then transfer the baking sheet 
        and rack of chicken to the refrigerator for 15 to 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Without crowding, lower chicken carefully into the hot oil in batches. Fry, tossing occasionally, until cooked through and the outside is crunchy and browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a paper 
        towel-lined plate to drain. Repeat with remaining chicken.</li>
</ol>
